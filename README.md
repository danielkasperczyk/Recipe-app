#  Recipe Aplication
To make this little project i used: 
- JavaScript (ES6+), JavaScript modules which i like to use
- API to fetch recipes from edamam
- HTML and CSS

While using this application You can:
- add recipe to your favorite (it will save recipes in LocalStorage)
- remove recipes from your favorite list (it will remove recipes from LocalStorage)
- search for new recipes

Design of this application is not very good, but functionality is on point
